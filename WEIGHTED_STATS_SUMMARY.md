- **Weight Override System**: Ability to adjust weights based on performance analysis

## 📊 Key Improvements Over Previous System

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Statistical Weighting** | ❌ All features equal weight | ✅ Sophisticated category-based weighting |
| **Sport Specificity** | ❌ One-size-fits-all approach | ✅ Sport-optimized configurations |
| **Transparency** | ❌ Black box predictions | ✅ Detailed feature importance and reasoning |
| **Configurability** | ❌ Hard-coded logic | ✅ Configurable weight system |
| **Prediction Quality** | ❌ Basic linear combination | ✅ Multi-layer scoring with confidence adjustment |
| **API Richness** | ❌ Simple outcome + confidence | ✅ Rich metadata, importance, diagnostics |

## 🎯 Impact on Prediction Accuracy

### Before: Basic Equal Weighting
```python
prediction = sum(all_features) / feature_count
confidence = base_confidence * model_accuracy
```

### After: Sophisticated Weighted System
```python
# Category-weighted feature extraction
weighted_features = apply_sport_weights(raw_features, sport)

# Multi-layer prediction
linear_score = weighted_linear_combination(weighted_features)
category_score = calculate_category_contributions(weighted_features)
combined_score = (0.7 * linear_score) + (0.3 * category_score)

# Enhanced confidence with multiple factors  
confidence = base_confidence * model_accuracy * certainty_factor
```

## 🧪 Testing and Validation

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **`demo_weights.py`**: Interactive demonstration of weight configurations
- **`test_weighted_predictions.py`**: Full integration testing of enhanced system
- **Visual Weight Charts**: Bar chart representations of category priorities

### Verified Functionality
- ✅ Weight configurations working across all sports
- ✅ Feature extraction applying weights correctly  
- ✅ Enhanced predictions generating rich metadata
- ✅ API endpoints returning weight information
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

## 🎪 User Experience Improvements

### Rich Prediction Explanations
**Before**: "Home team predicted to win with 75% confidence"

**After**: "Home team wins with 87.3% confidence. Head-to-Head strongly favors this outcome (impact: 0.85). Recent Performance shows significant advantage (impact: 0.72). High confidence due to strong statistical consensus across multiple factors."

### Feature Importance Insights
Users can now see exactly which statistics drove each prediction:
```json
{
  "feature_importance": {
    "head_to_head_win_rate": 0.23,
    "recent_win_percentage": 0.18,
    "home_field_advantage": 0.15
  }
}
```

### Category Contribution Analysis
Understanding which types of data matter:
```json
{
  "category_contributions": {
    "head_to_head": 0.85,
    "recent_performance": 0.72,
    "home_advantage": 0.61
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Next Iteration Opportunities

The weighted system now provides the foundation for:
